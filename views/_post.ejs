                              creating an anchor tag that helps to delete a post
                              the delete button should be visible to only signed in users and also to those users only
                              who have created the post .
                              Agar sabko dikhaenge delete ka option toh kuch faeda nahi hai isliye unhi ko dikhao
                              jinhone post ko create kiya hai aur woh logged in bhi ho

                              Again post.user.id will give object id of the user in string format since user field in
                              post schema is pre populated as we had done in home controller with the exact document
                              post.user._id is object id and post.user.id is object id in string format and as discussed
                              in destroy function of post controller string comparison is always the best
                              And as discussed in destroy function of post action in post controller we will user
                              locals.user.id and not locals.user._id
                              <% */ %>

                              <% /* %>
                             giving class to delte button to have common styling for all delete buttons
                              <% */ %>
                                <% if(locals.user && post.user.id==locals.user.id) {%>
                                  <a class="delete-post-button" href="/posts/destroy/<%=post.id%>"> X </a>
                                  <%}%>
                          </span>
                        
                      <br>
                      <small>
                        <%= post.user.name%>

                      For every post we will have a comments form
                      The comments form will be visible to only signed in users so that no one else comments
                      <% */ %>
                        <div class="post-comments">
                          <% /* %>
                            here we have class and not id for div because a single post can have multiple comments and
                            we want all those comments to have same
                            <% */ %>
                              <% if(locals.user) {%>

                                  <input type="text" name="content" placeholder="Type here to add your comment...">
                                  <% /* %>
                                    Next we need to send the post id to identify which post we have to add the comment ,
                                    so that is something we have to send
                                    so we can either allow user to send that or do it with hidden input we will be doing
                                    it with hidden input
                                    <% */ %>
                                      <input type="hidden" name="postId" value="<%=post._id%>">
                                      <input type="submit" value="Add comment">
